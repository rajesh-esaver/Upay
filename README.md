## EASY PAY
New way of paying shopping bills

## Azure Technology Used:
* Azure SQL Database
* Azure Cloud Functions

## Our Idea:
We want to introduce a new method for making the payments(in shopping malls etc). 
We often use cash, cards, UPI for making payments, how about doing the payment without including any of these ?. 
Yes, thatâ€™s our idea. We want people to make their payments with just their fingerprint.

## How we used Azure features in the prototype:
We have created a mobile app, using which users can see their transaction details.
Used Azure SQL database for storing the user information and transaction information etc.
Created a python script for reading the data from the Azure SQL database.
And hosted the above python scripts as independent serverless Azure Cloud Functions.

## Technology stack used in the prototype:
Android, Python, Azure SQL database, Azure Cloud Functions.
